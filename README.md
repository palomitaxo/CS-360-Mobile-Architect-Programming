-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The weight tracker app was developed to assist users in tracking their weight management goals. It helps with the need for users to monitor their weight progress and receive notifications to stay accountable to their goals and celebrating their accomplishment. The core features include a login page, a new user registration page, the ability to add and delete weight check-ins, highlighting goal weight, text message notifications, and the option to modify user credentials.

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To support user needs and promote their success of usage of the app, I included a simple and user-friendly login and registration page, dashboard to add, delete, and view weight check-ins, SMS notification settings for goals being met and user profile settings for changing credentials. The UI designs I managed were for users in mind to ensure simplicity and clarity in navigation. Clear buttons and labels were used to guide users. I incorporated health color to make it visually appealing and promoting the health aspect.

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I always try to take in the requirements in bite size pieces, when looking at everything, it can become overwhelming so it approach each situation it is best to take it step by step. This can be applied in any situation faced and promotes small accomplishments to even be celebrated.

-How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I try to double step myself many times and executing the program in Android Studio was essential, testing over and over and over again will always help and assist with debugging but making sure to do this in increments versus at the end. This will assist in finding problems as you go versus being faced with a multitude of them at the end.

-Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The connecting of databases was a tricky one for me. If I better planned and thought connectivity, I probably would not have been so flustered, but to overcome this I had to just analyze myself, think of the problem and again take it step by step.

-In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I am specifically happy with the design and layout of the app, I am just a visual person and took a lot of pride in this and just felt it came out better than what I anticipated.
